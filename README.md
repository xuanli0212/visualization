###Project1: US Poverty
You can find the demo of this project [here] (http://www.pitt.edu/~xul23/viz1/index-line.html)

**Introduction**

This report looks at the US poverty data which were generated under specific guideline from US  Census Bureau (2015). Analyzing vast volume of data, especially census data, can be a daunting  task. But as Keim (2002) stated, with the help of appropriate visualization techniques, faster and  more in-depth data exploration can be achieved.


###Project2: Social Network of Co-Purchase

You can find the demo of this project [Social Network](http://www.pitt.edu/~xul23/viz2) and   [Co-purchase Matrix](http://www.pitt.edu/~xul23/viz2/matrix.html)

**Introduction**

With an increasing number of people choosing to shop online rather than at a physical departmental store, co-purchasing network analysis has been widely adopted by a number of sites  including Amazon and EBay as a part of viral marketing strategy (Srivastava, 2010). This report looks  at the co-purchasing data from Amazon.com and aims to generate effective network visualizations. All data used in this project are extracted from Kerbâ€™s (n.d.) works.

###Final Project: Visualizing UFO Sighting in USA

You can find the demo of this final project [here](http://picso.org:8889/~classinfovis2015fall/projects/group-03/home.html)

**Introduction**

Given the fact that hundreds of unidentified flying object (UFO)sightings reports are being reported each month, analyzing the large number of UFO sightings reports can be increasingly difficult. This project looks at possible visualization solutions to help users gain more insights into these data. We collected our dataset from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) and used D3 to help generate the visualization. Geographical location of sightings over time, shape trending, peak time and frequently used words in the United States from 2004 to 2014, were all displayed in the system. The system will hopefully provide a clear demonstration of UFO sightings to common everyday users with limited prior knowledge.
